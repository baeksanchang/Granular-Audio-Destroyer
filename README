This is based on a ChucK project created by Baek San Chang of Haek Bayden/White Mountain fame.  His ChucK project was a lovely six channel granular playback engine of an audio file with variable grain size, speed, randomness, pitch, and effects.

This project attempts to recreate that ChucK project in a standalone desktop version that can mangle and manipulate audio offline.  

It's also useful as an exploration into the Juce Framework by rawmaterialsoftware.com

This project requires Juce 1.51 available for download from www.rawmaterialsoftware.com
